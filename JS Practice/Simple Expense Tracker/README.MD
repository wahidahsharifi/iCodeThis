# Simple Expense Tracker

In this mode, you are given the HTML and CSS template, and your focus should be on adding the required functionality with JavaScript.

> **Note:** You can't change the HTML and CSS (but you can use JavaScript to alter the DOM if needed).

Press **Submit** once you are done.

## Implement the following functionalities:

- When clicking on the **Add Expense** button, a new expense should be added to the `#expense-list`, taking the name and the price of the item from the inputs.
- Clear the `#item-name` and `#item-price` inputs when the expense is successfully added to the list.

### Optional tasks:
- Delete existing expenses on page load.
- Show a total sum of all expenses.
