# Make it Pop

In this mode, you are given the HTML and CSS template, and your focus should be on adding the required functionality with JavaScript.

> **Note:** You can't change the HTML and CSS (but you can use JavaScript to alter the DOM if needed).

Press **Submit** once you are done.

## Implement the following functionalities:

- Apply the `.active` class to the `<a>` tag that is clicked.
- This will make the selected item pop!

### Optional:
- Ensure that only one `<a>` tag has the `.active` class at a time.
