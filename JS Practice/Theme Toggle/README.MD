# Simple Theme Toggle

In this mode, you are given the **HTML** and **CSS** template, and your focus should be on adding the required functionality with **JavaScript**.

**Note:** You **can't** change the HTML and CSS (but you can use JavaScript to alter the DOM if needed).

Press **submit** once you are done.

## Implement the following functionalities:

- Use the toggle (`id="toggler"`) from the top of the page to complete the **theme toggle function**!
- Right now, the text-background contrast is **very poor** on the dark theme.
- Make it so that when the **input is checked**, the **text changes to white**, ensuring the page is **accessible** to all readers.
