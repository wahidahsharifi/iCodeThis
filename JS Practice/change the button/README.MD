# Change the Button

In this mode, you are given the HTML and CSS template, and your focus should be on adding the required functionality with JavaScript.

> **Note:** You can't change the HTML and CSS (but you can use JavaScript to alter the DOM if needed).

Press **Submit** once you are done.

## Implement the following changes to the button when it's clicked:

- Change the background color to `#fef6f5`.
- Change the text color of the button to `#f55153`.
- Change the text content to **"Clicked!"**.
