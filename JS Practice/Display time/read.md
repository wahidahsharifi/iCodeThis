# Display Time

In this mode, you are given the **HTML** and **CSS** template, and your focus should be on adding the required functionality with **JavaScript**.

**Note:** You **can't** change the HTML and CSS (but you can use JavaScript to alter the DOM if needed).

Press **submit** once you are done.

## Implement the following functionalities:

- Currently, the `div` with the `id` of `time` displays a static random time inside.  
  Update the clock to display the **correct current time**.
- It should run just like a **real clock**, updating the time **every second**.
